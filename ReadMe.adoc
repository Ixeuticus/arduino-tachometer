= Project: VTEC conroller (DIGITAL Tachometer)
12v ---> 10Kohm ---> Vin ( to power arduino )
GND ---> car negative

Vtec controller

Signal from distributer linked to pin 4 & through 160ohm resistor GND

  Distributer ---{220ohm}-----pin4
                          \--{100ohm}---GND pin

LEDs:
Common ground pin, 220ohm on positives, pins 9, 10, 11, 12
GND -> LED -> reistor -> pin

Vtec control pin 3

Tachometer output:
Connect CLK to 5
Connect DIO to 6
